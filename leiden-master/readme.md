# Portfolio Plugin

Some code to replace the "Portfolio Manager - Powered By Behance" plugin, so I can manage my portfolio locally instead

# Issues 

* make SiteUrl use local url instead of an additional http request
* automate previous and next post urls, instead of having to enter them manually for each project
